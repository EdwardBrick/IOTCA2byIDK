This is a repository for Internet of Things - Assignment (Nanidemo Tokei)
Oh yeah!
Ok so in order to start Nanidemo Tokei, you have to download all the files here, then run the files, in your Raspberry Pi. 
Run RFIDWorks.py via python RFIDWorks don't sudo.
Then run server.py.
As for the arduino code, load digitalclock.ino with RtcDSxxxx.h where xxxx is the model of your Real-time clock module and LEDMatrixDriver.hpp into your Arduino IDE, check port and model (We used a Arduino Uno) upload and walla.
